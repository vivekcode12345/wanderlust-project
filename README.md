# 🌍 Wanderlust – Travel Listing Web Application

Wanderlust is a full-stack travel listing web application inspired by platforms like Airbnb.  
Users can explore travel destinations, create listings, add reviews, and manage their own properties.

This project demonstrates my understanding of **backend development, database design, authentication, and MVC architecture** using modern web technologies.
